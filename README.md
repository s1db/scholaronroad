### 👋 Hi I'm Sid!
I'm a Computing Science Faster Route Scholar at [The University of Glasgow](https://gla.ac.uk). I'm on track for graduating with Master's in 2023. In the past I've worked on projects with [The Girl Code](https://thegirlcode.co/), [Data Science for India](), and [Sugar Labs](https://sugarlabs.org/). Back in Highschool I was a member of [MINET](https://minet.co/). 

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: The benches outside the university library are the best place to nap on campus.
